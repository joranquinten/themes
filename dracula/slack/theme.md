# Dracula them for Slack

In Slack, open the preferences, go to the Sidebar section and paste the following line in the Custom field:

```
#21222C,#44475A,#44475A,#50FA7B,#BD93F9,#FFFFFF,#FF79C6,#FF5555
```

This is not the [official Dracula Theme for Slack](https://draculatheme.com/slack/), but I like mine better, so there. ðŸ¦‡
